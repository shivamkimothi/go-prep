package is a collection of go files that share some functionality.
 there are two types of packages:

 executable  - generates a file that ca n run
 Reusable - code used as a helper. Good places to keep reusable logic.
 we can only use the word 'main' for the package that is executable in our project
this executable package must have a function 'main' in the file
